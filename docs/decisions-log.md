## Decisions

### 1. Container Strategy for Database Management (2024-03-XX)

**Context:**
- Project requires PostgreSQL database
- Need to determine whether to run database in separate container or within application container
- Development and production environments have different requirements
- Project scale is relatively small (4 users, limited data)

**Options Considered:**

1. **Separate Container Approach**
   - PostgreSQL runs in dedicated container
   - Managed via docker-compose
   - Clear separation of services
   
   Pros:
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Easy database management (reset/rebuild)
   - Matches common development patterns
   - Flexible for future scaling
   - Simple to switch to external DB if needed
   - Can use official PostgreSQL image directly
   
   Cons:
   - More complex container orchestration
   - Slightly higher resource overhead
   - More complex deployment

2. **Single Container Approach**
   - PostgreSQL installed within backend container
   - All services in one container
   
   Pros:
   - Simpler deployment
   - Lower resource overhead
   - Easier initial setup
   
   Cons:
   - Less flexible
   - Harder to maintain/backup
   - Mixing service concerns
   - More complex container builds

**Decision:**
- Development: Use separate containers (backend, frontend, db) managed by docker-compose
- Production: Start with separate containers, with option to consolidate if resource constraints become issue

**Rationale:**
1. Development benefits:
   - Better local development experience
   - Easier testing and data management
   - More realistic service boundary simulation
   - Flexibility to modify configuration
   
2. Production considerations:
   - Starting with separate containers maintains consistency with development
   - Can optimize later if needed
   - Small overhead is acceptable for benefits gained

**Implications:**
- Need to maintain docker-compose configuration
- Need to document container management procedures
- May need to revisit decision if production resources become constraint
- Backup procedures should account for separate database container

**Status:** Active

### 2. Docker Operational Procedures (2024-03-XX)

**Context:**
- Need consistent procedures for Docker operations
- Database verification requires specific command flags
- Container management needs clear documentation

**Key Procedures:**

1. **Starting Docker Services**
   ```bash
   # Detached mode (recommended for development)
   docker compose up --build -d   # Runs containers in background
   
   # Interactive mode (for debugging)
   docker compose up --build      # Shows live logs in terminal
   ```
   
   Pros of detached mode:
   - Frees up terminal for other commands
   - Easier to run verification commands
   - Can still access logs via `docker compose logs`
   
   Cons of detached mode:
   - Need extra command to view logs
   - May miss immediate startup issues

2. **Database Verification Commands**
   ```bash
   # List databases (with pagination disabled)
   docker compose exec db psql -U postgres -c "\l" --no-psqlrc -P pager=off
   
   # Connect to specific database
   docker compose exec db psql -U postgres -d game_night_dev --no-psqlrc -P pager=off
   ```
   
   Important flags:
   - `--no-psqlrc`: Prevents loading user's psql configuration
   - `-P pager=off`: Disables interactive pagination
   - These flags ensure clean, non-interactive output

3. **Container Management**
   ```bash
   # View container status
   docker compose ps
   
   # View container logs
   docker compose logs [service_name]
   
   # Restart specific service
   docker compose restart [service_name]
   
   # Shutdown procedures
   docker compose down              # Stop and remove containers, networks
   docker compose down -v           # Also remove volumes (deletes database data)
   docker compose down --rmi all    # Also remove all images
   ```
   
   Shutdown options:
   - Basic down: Preserves data volumes and images
   - With `-v`: Removes volumes (fresh start)
   - With `--rmi all`: Complete cleanup
   
   Best practices:
   - Use basic `down` for temporary shutdown
   - Use `-v` when you need to reset database state
   - Use `--rmi all` when you need to rebuild from scratch

**Rationale:**
- Clear procedures reduce debugging time
- Non-interactive commands are better for scripts and CI/CD
- Consistent flags ensure reproducible behavior

**Implications:**
- Team members should follow these procedures
- CI/CD scripts should use these non-interactive flags
- Documentation should be updated if better practices are discovered

**Status:** Active
