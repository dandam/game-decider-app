### **Processing Infrastructure Ready**
- **`bga_processor.py`**: Main data importer (games, players, history)
- **`player_stats_parser.py`**: HTML profile to JSON processor  
- **`session_processor.py`**: Future session data processor
- **CLI Commands**: Ready-to-run data import commands
- **Database Schema**: All tables created and migrated

### **Data Quality Assessment**
- **4 Core Players**: dandam, superoogie, permagoof, gundlach
- **Rich Game Statistics**: 3,000+ games per player with ELO ratings, win rates
- **Complete Game Catalog**: 1,082+ BoardGameArena games with IDs
- **Avatar Assets**: Local JPG files for all players
- **Processing Ready**: All raw data in expected formats

## Task Requirements

Transform the collected raw BoardGameArena data into structured database records that power the Game Night Concierge application. The processing must:

1. **Extract and normalize game catalog** from HTML into database records
2. **Process player profiles and statistics** into structured player and history records  
3. **Transform match history** from aggregate stats into relational data
4. **Implement data validation** to ensure data integrity
5. **Create reproducible processing pipeline** via CLI commands
6. **Document data structures and relationships** for future reference

## Implementation Plan

### **Phase 1: Game Catalog Processing**

**Objective**: Import 1,082+ BoardGameArena games into the `games` table

**Command**:
```bash
docker compose exec backend python -m app.cli process-bga --data-path /app/data
```

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Games imported with BGA IDs, names, and metadata
- Proper handling of special characters and game variants
- Duplicate prevention based on BGA game IDs
- Validation of required fields (name, player counts)

**Verification**:
```bash
# Check games imported
docker compose exec db psql -U postgres -d game_night_dev -c "
  SELECT COUNT(*) as total_games, 
         COUNT(DISTINCT bga_id) as unique_bga_ids
  FROM games;"

# Sample games check
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/games?limit=5
```

### **Phase 2: Player Profile Processing**

**Objective**: Create player records with avatars and basic metadata

**Process**:
- Extract BGA usernames from HTML profiles
- Set up local avatar paths for each player
- Create player records with proper relationships
- Link to preferences system (created in Task #31)

**Expected Outcomes**:
- 4 player records: dandam, superoogie, permagoof, gundlach
- Local avatar paths (`/avatars/{player}-avatar.jpg`)
- Proper UUID generation and relationship setup
- Integration with existing PlayerPreferences

**Verification**:
```bash
# Check players imported
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/players

# Verify player preferences integration
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/players/{player_id}/preferences
```

### **Phase 3: Game Statistics Processing**

**Objective**: Transform aggregate player stats into `PlayerGameHistory` records

**Process**:
- Parse extracted JSON statistics for each player
- Convert aggregate stats (games played, win rates, ratings) into history records
- Create one record per player per game played
- Calculate ratings and performance metrics
- Handle different game types and scoring systems

**Expected Outcomes**:
- 390+ game history records across all players
- Proper player-game relationships
- Calculated ratings based on win percentages and ELO where available
- Data ready for compatibility scoring algorithm

**Verification**:
```bash
# Check game history records
docker compose exec db psql -U postgres -d game_night_dev -c "
  SELECT p.username, COUNT(pgh.*) as games_with_history
  FROM players p 
  LEFT JOIN player_game_history pgh ON p.id = pgh.player_id
  GROUP BY p.username;"

# Test compatibility scoring with real data
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/games/{game_id}/compatibility?player_id={player_id}"
```

### **Phase 4: Data Validation & Quality Assurance**

**Objective**: Ensure data integrity and completeness

**Validation Checks**:
- Foreign key relationships properly established
- No duplicate records based on business logic
- Required fields populated for all records
- Data types and constraints satisfied
- Game compatibility scoring works with real data

**Quality Metrics**:
```bash
# Comprehensive data validation
docker compose exec db psql -U postgres -d game_night_dev -c "
  SELECT 
    'Games' as entity, COUNT(*) as count FROM games
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 
    'Players' as entity, COUNT(*) as count FROM players  
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 
    'Game History' as entity, COUNT(*) as count FROM player_game_history
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 
    'Player Preferences' as entity, COUNT(*) as count FROM player_preferences;"
```

### **Phase 5: Documentation & Reproducibility**

**Objective**: Document the processing pipeline and data structures

**Deliverables**:
- Update processing documentation in `docs/data-layer/bga-data-processing.md`
- Create data import runbook for future use
- Document any data limitations or special cases encountered
- Validate that processing commands are idempotent

## CLI Commands Reference

### **Primary Processing Command**
```bash
# Main BGA data import (games, players, history)
docker compose exec backend python -m app.cli process-bga --data-path /app/data
```

### **Statistics Extraction** (If needed)
```bash
# Extract player stats from HTML (already done but re-runnable)
docker compose exec backend python -m app.cli extract-player-stats --data-path /app/data
```

### **Database Verification Commands**
```bash
# Check database container status
docker compose ps

# Connect to database for manual inspection
docker compose exec db psql -U postgres -d game_night_dev

# Check API endpoints with real data
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health/db
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/games?limit=10
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/players
```
