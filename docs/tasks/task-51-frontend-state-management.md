# Task 51: Frontend State Management

**Milestone**: 2 - MVP Core  
**Priority**: P0  
**Status**: To Do  
**Size**: M  
**Branch**: `feature/task-51-frontend-state-management`

## Context & Background

You are working on the **Game Decider** application, a modern web app that helps groups decide which board games to play. This is **Task 51** from **Milestone 2: MVP Core**, focusing on implementing comprehensive frontend state management.

**Essential Documentation - Please Review Before Starting:**
- `docs/implementation/task-48-frontend-api-client.md` - API client architecture and usage patterns
- `docs/implementation/task-49-frontend-component-library.md` - Component library structure and theming
- `frontend/src/lib/api/README.md` - API client documentation and examples
- `frontend/README.md` - Frontend architecture and development setup
- `docs/pm-tracking/milestone-2.md` - Current milestone context and dependencies

## Getting Started

1. **Create new branch**: `feature/task-51-frontend-state-management`
2. **Review essential documentation** listed above for context
3. **Study existing API client**: Understand integration patterns in `frontend/src/lib/api/`
4. **Start with core store setup**: Implement Zustand with TypeScript configuration
5. **Build incrementally**: Implement one slice at a time with tests
6. **Test integration**: Verify API client integration works seamlessly

## Current Project State

**Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: None (to be implemented)
- **API Integration**: Comprehensive type-safe API client with retry logic
- **Component Library**: CVA-based components with theming support
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library with 80% coverage threshold

**Existing Foundation:**
- ✅ API client with Players, Games, Preferences, Health endpoints (Task #48)
- ✅ Component library with theming and accessibility (Task #49)
- ✅ Complete TypeScript definitions matching backend Pydantic schemas
- ✅ HTTP utilities, error handling, retry logic, request deduplication
- ✅ Development environment with Docker and hot reload

## Requirements

Implement a production-ready state management solution that:

### Core State Management
1. **Global Application State**
   - User authentication and session management
   - Current player profile and permissions
   - Application-wide UI state (theme, loading, errors)
   - Navigation and routing state

2. **Domain-Specific State**
   - Game library state (filters, search, pagination)
   - Player management state (profiles, preferences)
   - Game selection workflow state
   - Temporary form state and optimistic updates

3. **Server State Integration**
   - Seamless integration with existing API client
   - Cache management for API responses
   - Optimistic updates for user actions
   - Background refresh and synchronization

### Technical Requirements
1. **TypeScript Integration**
   - Full type safety for all state operations
   - IntelliSense support for state selectors
   - Type-safe action creators and reducers
   - Integration with existing API types

2. **Next.js Compatibility**
   - SSR/SSG compatibility where applicable
   - Client-side hydration without flicker
   - Route-based state management
   - Proper cleanup on navigation

3. **Performance**
   - Minimal re-renders through selective subscriptions
   - Efficient state updates and batching
   - Memory leak prevention
   - Bundle size optimization

4. **Developer Experience**
   - Clear state structure and organization
   - Debugging tools integration
   - Hot reload support
   - Clear documentation and examples

## Recommended Technical Approach

Use **Zustand** as the primary state management solution because it:
- Provides excellent TypeScript support
- Works seamlessly with Next.js App Router
- Offers minimal boilerplate compared to Redux
- Supports both client and server state patterns
- Provides middleware for persistence, devtools, etc.
- Aligns with the project's functional programming preferences

- **Game Sessions**: Session creation, player selection, game matching workflows
- **UI State**: Theme persistence, loading states, error handling, modal management

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
```typescript
// Example test structure
describe('Game Store', () => {
  it('should filter games by category', () => {
    // Test game filtering logic
  });
  
  it('should handle optimistic game selection', () => {
    // Test optimistic updates
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests

- State persistence across page refreshes
- Concurrent state updates handling
- Error boundary integration

### Performance Tests
- Bundle size impact measurement
- Re-render frequency analysis
- Memory leak detection

## Key Implementation Notes

### 1. API Client Integration
```typescript
// Example integration pattern
const useGameStore = create<GameState>((set, get) => ({
  games: [],
  loading: false,
  
  fetchGames: async (filters) => {
    set({ loading: true });
    try {
      const games = await Games.getGames(filters);
      set({ games, loading: false });
    } catch (error) {
      set({ error: error.message, loading: false });
    }
  }
}));
```

### 2. Type Safety
- Leverage existing API types from `frontend/src/lib/api/types.ts`
- Create store-specific types that extend API types
- Ensure type safety for all state operations

### 3. Next.js Patterns
- Use proper client-side only initialization
- Handle SSR/hydration correctly
- Implement proper cleanup on unmount

### 4. Error Handling
- Integrate with existing error handling patterns from API client
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Implement retry logic for failed operations

## Environment Considerations

**Development:**
- Enable detailed logging and debugging tools
- Hot reload support for state changes
- Performance monitoring and warnings

**Production:**
- Disable debug logging
- Optimize bundle size
- Enable error tracking integration

## Next Steps After Completion

This implementation will enable:
- Task #50: Loading and Error States (direct integration)
- Task #34: Player profile UI components
- Task #35: Game library UI components  
- Task #38: Player preferences UI
- All Sprint 2.2 frontend features

## Technical Constraints
