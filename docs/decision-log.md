# Technical Decision Log

## 2024-05-XX: Spike Task Prioritization in Milestone 2

### Context
After completing the BoardGameArena integration spike (Task #25), we needed to determine the optimal sequence for remaining spike tasks (#23 Theming, #24 Analytics) to maximize development efficiency and minimize rework.

### Decision
Prioritize the Theming Strategy spike (Task #23) before Analytics Architecture spike (Task #24).

### Rationale
1. **Architectural Impact**
   - Theming decisions affect all UI components
   - Early theming decisions reduce technical debt
   - Component library and UI tasks (34-41) depend on theming foundation
   - Changing theming approach mid-development would be costly

2. **Dependency Analysis**
   - BGA spike completion provided data model insights
   - Theming spike unblocks frontend development
   - Analytics spike less critical for MVP core features
   - Frontend work represents significant portion of milestone tasks

3. **Risk Management**
   - Frontend consistency crucial for user experience
   - Theming affects performance and accessibility
   - Design system decisions impact team velocity
   - Analytics can be integrated later with less disruption

### Consequences
- **Positive**
  - Enables parallel frontend development streams
  - Establishes consistent design system early
  - Reduces risk of UI-related rework
  - Clear path for component library development

- **Negative**
  - Analytics integration might require minor UI adjustments later
  - Delayed insight into performance tracking needs

### Status
- Approved
- Implementation starting with Task #23
