## Phase 3: Advanced Filtering - Ready to Begin

   - Individual player checkboxes (dandam, superoogie, permagoof, gundlach)
   - Player combination logic (ANY vs ALL selected players)
   - "Show games played by:" interface

2. **Traditional Game Filters**

   - Play time ranges (< 30min, 30-60min, 60-90min, 90min+)
   - Complexity filter (Light 1-2, Medium 2-3.5, Heavy 3.5+)
   - Category multi-select with available categories

3. **Filter UI System**
   - Collapsible filter panel
   - Filter sections with clear organization
   - Active filter indicators and badges
   - Reset all filters functionality

### Technical Foundation Ready
- ✅ **Existing Components**: GameFilters.tsx component exists
- ✅ **State Management**: useGameFilters hook implemented
- ✅ **API Integration**: Backend supports filtering parameters
- ✅ **Type Safety**: TypeScript interfaces defined
- ✅ **Styling System**: Tailwind CSS classes established

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Start with Player Filtering**: Most requested feature
2. **Integrate with existing toggle system**: Filters apply to current game mode
3. **Build incrementally**: Add one filter type at a time
4. **Test each addition**: Verify functionality before moving to next filter
5. **Maintain working state**: Don't break existing Phase 1 & 2 features

## Success Metrics for Phase 3
- [ ] Player-based filtering working (filter by individual players)
- [ ] Traditional filters working (player count, time, complexity)
- [ ] Filter combinations working properly
- [ ] Filter UI is intuitive and responsive
- [ ] Filter state persists during mode switches
- [ ] Active filters display clearly
- [ ] Reset functionality works
- [ ] Performance remains good with filtered results

## Ready to Proceed
**Status**: ✅ Ready for Phase 3 Implementation  
**Foundation**: Solid working base with Phases 1 & 2 complete  
**Next Step**: Begin Phase 3 Advanced Filtering implementation  
**Risk Level**: Low (building on proven working foundation)
