# BoardGameArena Data Access Spike
*Related to Task #25 in [Milestone 2](../pm-tracking/milestone-2.md)*

## Overview
Investigation into methods for accessing player game data from BoardGameArena (BGA) for use in our game recommendation engine.

## Key Findings

### Official API Status
- No public API available for accessing player data or game statistics
- BGA's only official APIs are for game development within their Studio platform
- No documented process for requesting API access

### Existing Solutions
Several projects have attempted to interact with BGA data:

1. Browser Extensions:
   - [BGA Chrome Extension](https://github.com/FlavienBusseuil/bga-chrome-extension) - Monitors games in progress
   - [Opera/Firefox versions](https://addons.opera.com/extensions/details/board-game-arena-bga-extension/) also available

2. Data Export Tools:
   - [bga_to_bgg](https://github.com/kamaradclimber/bga_to_bgg) - Syncs BGA plays with BoardGameGeek
   - [bga_bgstats](https://github.com/ctuncan/bga_bgstats) - Creates BGStats import files from BGA data

### Available Options

1. Manual Data Collection (Recommended Short-term)
   - Players manually export game history/stats from BGA profile
   - Initial collection to understand available data
   - Document collection process and challenges
   - Pros: Accurate, immediate solution
   - Cons: Manual effort required

2. Browser Extension (Potential Mid-term)
   - Build custom extension for automated data collection
   - Focus on specific stats needed for our app
   - Similar to existing BGA extensions but more targeted
   - Pros: Automated collection
   - Cons: Development effort, maintenance required

3. Web Scraping (Potential Long-term)
   - Would require explicit permission from BGA
   - Must follow Terms of Service and robots.txt
   - Implement proper rate limiting
   - Pros: Fully automated
   - Cons: Fragile, requires maintenance, potential Terms of Service issues

## Recommendations

1. Immediate Action:
   - Begin manual data collection for research purposes
   - Document what data is available and how it can be accessed
   - Note any patterns, inconsistencies, or special cases
   - Use findings to inform future schema design

2. Future Steps:
   - Contact BGA regarding potential API access
   - Evaluate browser extension development
   - Monitor BGA platform changes that might affect data access

## Data Collection Structure

### Research Phase
Initial data collection will focus on understanding:
- Available data points and formats
- Access methods and limitations
- Data consistency and special cases
- Collection process challenges

Directory structure for research:
```
data/
  ├── raw/       # Raw data exports and samples from BGA
  └── research/  # Notes, findings, and analysis
```

## Next Steps
1. Begin collecting 30 days of game results
2. Document the manual collection process and challenges
3. Analyze collected data to inform schema design
4. Use findings to guide development of automated solutions
