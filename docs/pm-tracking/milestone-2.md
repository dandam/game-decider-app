# Milestone 2: MVP Core

Sprint 2 focuses on implementing the core functionality of the application, including player profiles, game library, and basic filtering engine. This milestone establishes the foundational data models and business logic that will support future features.

## Research Spikes

Before beginning implementation, we need to complete these research spikes to inform our technical decisions:

### Spike 1: Theming Strategy (2-3 days)
- Compare CSS variables + Tailwind vs. CSS-in-JS approaches
- Evaluate theme provider patterns and component library impact
- Create small POC for chosen approach
- Document findings and recommendations

### Spike 2: Analytics Architecture (2-3 days)
- Research skill vs. preference scoring models
- Define core metrics for tracking
- Design flexible schema for future analytics
- Document data model recommendations

### Spike 3: BoardGameArena Integration (3-4 days)
- Document API access rules and rate limits
- Map available data fields
- Test authentication flow
- Create sample data payload
- Document integration approach
