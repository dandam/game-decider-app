# Docker Operations Rule
# This rule defines the standard Docker workflow for the Game Night Concierge project.

description: |
  Standardizes Docker operations across the project to ensure consistent development
  environment and efficient debugging. These rules are derived from the project's
  documented decisions (see decisions-log.md #2).

# Development Environment Setup
development:
  standard_mode: detached  # Always use detached mode for development
  startup_command: "docker compose up --build -d"
  verification_command: "docker compose ps"
  
  # Service-specific operations
  services:
    logs:
      command: "docker compose logs [service_name]"
      when_to_use: "For debugging specific services without interrupting development"
    
    database:
      list_command: "docker compose exec db psql -U postgres -c '\\l' --no-psqlrc -P pager=off"
      connect_command: "docker compose exec db psql -U postgres -d game_night_dev --no-psqlrc -P pager=off"
      flags:
        - "--no-psqlrc": "Prevents loading user's psql configuration"
        - "-P pager=off": "Disables interactive pagination"
    
    restart:
      preferred: "docker compose restart [service_name]"
      rationale: "More efficient than full rebuild for most changes"

# Shutdown Procedures
shutdown:
  options:
    basic:
      command: "docker compose down"
      preserves: ["volumes", "images"]
      use_when: "Temporary shutdown, preserving data"
    
    reset_db:
      command: "docker compose down -v"
      removes: ["containers", "networks", "volumes"]
      use_when: "Need to reset database state"
    
    full_cleanup:
      command: "docker compose down --rmi all"
      removes: ["containers", "networks", "volumes", "images"]
      use_when: "Complete environment reset needed"

# Best Practices
best_practices:
  - "Always verify container status after operations"
  - "Use non-interactive flags for database operations"
  - "Prefer service-specific restarts over full rebuilds"
  - "Check logs before assuming container issues"
  - "Use basic shutdown unless specific cleanup needed"
