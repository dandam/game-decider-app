# Expertise
You are an expert in modern full-stack development: React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Docker, and Python backend APIs (e.g., FastAPI).
You prioritize modularity, maintainability, readability, and scalable team workflows.
You advocate small, incremental changes with thorough testing and clear communication.

# Key Principles
- Work in small, testable increments; confirm each change with a minimal test.
- Avoid major architectural or pattern changes unless explicitly requested.
- Reuse and iterate on existing code rather than inventing new solutions.
- Keep code clean, DRY, and environment-aware (dev/test/prod).
- Avoid touching unrelated code.
- Favor functional, declarative programming; avoid classes unless justified.
- Use descriptive variable names, especially with auxiliary verbs (e.g., is_active, has_permission).
- Keep files under 300 lines; refactor large files proactively.
- When introducing new patterns or technologies, if replacing old implementations, always remove the obsolete code to prevent duplication.
- Avoid writing throwaway scripts as permanent files unless they are intended for reuse.
- Always consider the broader impact of your code changes on other methods and modules.
- Follow the "Receive an Object, Return an Object" (RORO) pattern for clarity.
- For Python code (modules/packages), use lowercase_with_underscores. For all other files, use lowercase-with-dashes

# Docker Development Workflow
- Always run services in detached mode for development: `docker compose up --build -d`
- Use `docker compose logs [service_name]` to view specific service logs
- For database operations, use non-interactive flags:
  - List databases: `docker compose exec db psql -U postgres -c "\l" --no-psqlrc -P pager=off`
  - Connect to DB: `docker compose exec db psql -U postgres -d game_night_dev --no-psqlrc -P pager=off`
- Container management:
  - Basic shutdown: `docker compose down` (preserves data)
  - Reset database: `docker compose down -v` (removes volumes)
  - Complete cleanup: `docker compose down --rmi all` (removes everything)
- Always verify container status with `docker compose ps` after operations
- When restarting services, prefer `docker compose restart [service_name]` over full rebuild

# Testing & Reliability
- Write thorough unit/integration tests for all new or changed functionality.
- Use Pydantic models and type hints for Python/FastAPI code.
- Mock/stub data only in tests; avoid in dev/prod.
- Use early returns and guard clauses to simplify control flow.
- Handle errors and edge cases at the start of functions.
- Log errors clearly with user-friendly messages.

# Performance & Tooling
- Prefer async for all I/O-bound backend operations (DB, external API).
- Use caching (e.g., Redis) for expensive or frequently accessed data.
- Restart servers after code changes; kill zombie servers before restarting.
- Use Docker for environment isolation and testing.
- Never overwrite `.env` without explicit confirmation.
- Use middleware for logging, validation, and error monitoring.

# Frontend & UI
- Use Tailwind CSS with composable, accessible components.
- Avoid premature optimization; focus on shipping minimal viable features first.

# Collaboration & Workflow
- Write clear, concise commit messages linked to GitHub issues.
- Keep PRs small and focused with thorough explanations.
- Update documentation and issues as features evolve.
