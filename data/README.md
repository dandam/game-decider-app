## Directory Structure

- `raw/` - Raw data exports and samples from BGA

## Initial Data Collection

The goal is to collect 30 days of game results for our 4 players to understand:
- What data is available
- In what format it can be accessed
- What limitations or challenges exist
- What patterns emerge in the data structure

This research will inform our later tasks of:
- Designing proper data schemas
- Building automated collection tools
- Implementing data processing pipelines

## Notes

- Focus on collecting whatever data is readily available
- Document the collection process and any challenges
- Note any inconsistencies or special cases in the data
- Keep raw data in its original form for analysis
